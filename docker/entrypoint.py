"""Container entrypoint: take ownership of a fresh data folder, then run as `zimi`.

Docker creates a bind-mounted folder that does not exist yet as root:root, and
the server runs as the unprivileged `zimi` user (uid 1000), which then cannot
write its own state and refuses to start. Platforms that create the folder for
you (Project NOMAD's custom apps, Portainer, Unraid templates) hit this on the
first run. So the image starts as root for the length of one chown and drops
privileges before Zimi's code runs.

What it touches, and what it never does:

* The data folder (--data-dir, else ZIMI_DATA_DIR), and Zimi's own library
  folder (--zim-dir, else ZIM_DIR) only while it is empty: a fresh mount has
  no files to be wrong about. Never a library folder that holds files, and
  never an extra or read-only one (ZIMI_EXTRA_ZIM_DIRS): those are somebody's.
* Only when the folder is owned by root and `zimi` cannot already write to it.
  A folder some other user owns is left alone and the error says how to fix it.
* Started with --user (or runAsUser), the process is not root, so nothing is
  attempted: a data folder it cannot write is named on stderr and the server's
  own check then stops with its message.

Standard library only, and it must not import `zimi` (that package binds paths
at import time, and this runs as root).
